# Charmed-house-life-immitation

The project aims at immitating the life of a familiy consisting of 4 ppl and 2 domestic animals (the number can change as per request). Each habitant performs one action a day based on a random choice of a dice. Each memeber of a family must make it till the end of the year. 

This is my very first try to solve a problem using the OOP.
